			'During my time at Oulun Ammattikorkeakoulu (Oulu University of Applied Sciences), where I earned a Bachelor of Information Technology, I developed a strong foundation in software development. My specialization in software development provided me with in-depth knowledge and practical skills in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. Through courses like Advanced Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Development, and Database Management Systems, I gained a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical concepts and their real-world applications."',

			'"To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?

			'"These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."  - "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero in 45 BC',
